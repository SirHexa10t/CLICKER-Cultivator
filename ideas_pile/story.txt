There will be a top-level/top-rival/final-boss guy whom you'd have to beat at some point
    The showdown would include a lot of clicking
    One of the funny revelations during the final showdown is that since the top-rival is so much further than you in Daoism, his wisdom surpasses yours by far
        So you have to be much stronger than the last boss before facing him (again), so that you can argue with him successfully before you fight
        You also need to have a longer title-list (the final boss would have a very long list)


The final boss would have big hatred towards you (the ascending main character). He'll send various goons and control the elements of reality (space-time and anything else) to get rid of you.
    He'll control them even while you surpass his level somewhat. It's a "first-comes" kind of deal.


Just like how Cookie Clicker has the Grandma assets as the catalyst for the apocalypse in the story, the catalyst for the final boss would be martial arts training (which requires a lot of movement on the ground)
    It would turn out that the final boss is a small ant that you stepped on during early training. The ant had such a grudge that it decided to start a cultivation journey
    The ant surpasses you thanks to your failed usages of time-skip trainings, which instead of giving you a lot of training while the world stands still it gives you almost no training while the world continued on for many years

There'll be a message about your training results, and in one of them (specific to a certain building) there'll also be small appended notice about you stepping on an ant
    A later mind training would have you remember various bad things you did, and among other things, recall and settle your memory of stepping on an ant once in training

The final argument with the final boss would last very long and would be so in-depth and profound that both sides would level-up due to the knowledge break-throughs.
    Parts of the argument would be "untranslatable" as the reader/player's (in-real-life) level would be too low to correctly comprehend the meaning of what they're saying
    The conclusion would align with the rather simple conclusion the MC made back in early mind training, which would lead to some vague bullshit saying about the profound being simple and the simple being profound (and something around potentially easy vs hard solutions for the same problem in maths)
        This would basically be astounding for the final boss, which would basically be at peace thanks to it and go on to the afterlife (basically death, not reincarnation)

Upon beating the final boss, he'll let go of his grudge and unlock the higher levels, allowing you and others to keep ascending further. From that point on there's no reason to keep on training other than pursue higher numbers
