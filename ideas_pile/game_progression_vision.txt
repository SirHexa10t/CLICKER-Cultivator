What's the main goal? Should be measurable, just like "number of cookies".

train
get friends
    do errands
    get favors
    political ties
items and money
get women
unlock and train mind
    perks (such as mind-reading/sending)
    comprehensions
acquire mystical beast(s?)
gain followers
gain emperor's favor
go on adventures

become leader of institutes/sects
craft better items (best for current levels)
transcend into godhood

Higher plane (a god of previous plane is regular in current plane):
    everything from before, but more serious (everything is upgraded)
    

repeat until reaching the highest plane (until a game update would invent new planes)
    can always grow stronger; gain more followers, be capable of lifting more mountains, mind-heal people faster... Generally stronger.
